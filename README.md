# Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation with Dash

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for practicing useful skills in data visualization and creating interactive dashboards using Dash, a Python web framework. The code covers various topics including obtaining raw data, cleaning the data, choosing and creating appropriate visualizations, and developing an interactive dashboard with Dash.

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis of data from a small company and provide useful insights to the owner of the company through interactive visualizations. The key steps involved in achieving this objective include:

1. Obtaining the raw data that will be used for visualization and analysis.
2. Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure its suitability for visualization.
3. Choosing and creating appropriate visualizations based on the characteristics of the data.
4. Developing an interactive dashboard using Dash to present the visualizations in a user-friendly manner.

## Topics Covered

- Obtaining and uploading raw data
- Cleaning and preprocessing data for visualization
- Choosing and creating appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, scatter plots)
- Developing an interactive dashboard with Dash
